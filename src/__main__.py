1. The response time is perfect. The keys feel just right and donâ€™t make a loud clack. The lights are cool especially if you like to keep your room dark. Just a great keyboard at a nice price.
2. It suits me well, as described.
3. I love this keyboard. It is really nice to type on. I love the scroll volume control and I like the colourful lighting.
4. worst keyboard i ever used because it is too noisy
5. It is a brilliant, a beautiful keyboard. Plenty of customizations.
